#### The crash box is one of the energy-absorbing structures in automobiles. Its deformation mechanism under frontal impact is comprehensively studied. In the above-mentioned article, data from the impact simulations performed in Simulia ABAQUS (version 2021) are needed. For ML framework simulation data is generated and published here.

#### Every structure contains some form of manufacturing or material impurities and this is often unknown. These impurities affect the structural behaviour. Therefore, to simulate the realistic deformations of the crash box numerical imperfection is manually added. To ensure the imperfection is not arbitrary, linear combinations of eigenmodes are used *(ref)*. Therefore
